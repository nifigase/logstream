Logstream is a header-only library.
It depends on boost libraries.
Your program (as well as example program) must be linked against boost_thread and boost_filesystem libraries.

Logstream source is in logstream/ directory.
Example program source is in example/ directory.

To build example using Scons just type
$ scons

We do not use autotools for such simple projects, sorry.
Enjoy!
